# Tech Walkthrough with TA - Frontend Development

## Introduction
Hi my name is [Kalen Wallin](https://kalenwallin.com). I'm a junior honors student in computer science and a teaching assistant for Bhuvana Gopal in Software Engineering. In this walkthrough, I will be sharing how I created the frontend of my group's login page for our project website. We will be using HTML, CSS, and C#.

If you'd like to follow along, you will need to have Visual Studio installed.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or double click it in the file explorer.
3. (Optional) Remove the code in Login.cshtml and the Login page styles in site.css.
