# Tech Walkthrough with TA - Frontend Development

## Introduction
Hi my name is Kalen Wallin. I'm a junior honors student in computer science and a teaching assistant for Bhuvana Gopal in Software Engineering. In this walkthrough, I will be sharing how I created the frontend of my group's login page for our project website. We will be using HTML, CSS, and C#.

If you'd like to follow along, you will need to have Visual Studio installed.
